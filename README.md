# An online student helpdesk
In order to improve the support available to students, a student help desk will be implemented. 
This dedicated help desk will focus solely on supporting students within the education center, providing an intuitive and self-service system for submitting tickets.
Students will be able to easily file a ticket via their personal dashboard, detailing the issue and attaching relevant images. 
The student support team will consist of trained staff who will work to resolve issues in a timely manner, with student satisfaction being tracked and used to improve the service. 
By offering support during specified hours, the online help desk will save both time and money for both the students and the university, providing consistent and convenient support for all.
